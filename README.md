# 🕯️ Hollowbound 🧟‍♀️

**Hollowbound** is a first-person **psychological horror escape game** where every sound could save you — or doom you.  
You awaken in a **rotting mansion**, surrounded by darkness and static, cut off from the outside world.  
Your only goal: **collect all three keys and escape before Zuzuka finds you.**

Every flicker of the light, every step you take, every second of silence — **she’s listening.**

---

## 🧠 Game Overview 

In **Hollowbound**, you are trapped in a desolate house where every signal has vanished.  
No network. No radio. No light beyond your flashlight’s faint beam.  
The mansion creaks with life — as though the walls themselves remember every scream that once echoed within them.

To escape, you must locate **three cursed keys**, each hidden in a different section of the mansion. 
But there’s something else here — **Zuzuka** — the creature that rules this hollow space.  
She sees through sound, moves through silence, and feeds on fear.

---

## 🏚️ The Setting

The house you wake up in is massive, cold, and strangely alive.  
Once a **research facility disguised as a mansion**, it was abandoned after a failed experiment that attempted to send human consciousness through radio waves.  
When the signal died, something came back instead.

Now the air itself feels wrong — time flickers, lights hum, and reality bends as static fills your ears.  
Somewhere deep in the mansion, **Zuzuka waits**, drawn to your every move.

## 💀 The Villain — Zuzuka

Zuzuka is the corrupted remnant of the experiment gone wrong.  
Once a scientist obsessed with bridging life and death, she’s now nothing more than a rotting echo of sound — her voice distorted and her body half-dead, half-digital.

**About Her:**
- **Appearance:** A decayed, pale figure shrouded in black static — her movements glitch between frames.
- **Behavior:**
  - She listens more than she sees.
  - When the environment goes completely silent, she knows where you are.
  - Her approach is signaled by interference — your screen flickers, lights distort, and faint static grows louder.
- **Weakness:**
  - Noise and motion confuse her briefly.
  - Opening doors, walking, or flicking the flashlight can delay her detection — but not for long.
  - If you hear her whisper, it’s already too late.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| 🎯 **Objective** | Collect all three keys to unlock the final exit gate and escape the mansion. |
| 🔦 **Exploration** | Navigate through dark corridors, locked rooms, and crumbling staircases using only your flashlight. |
| 🗝️ **Keys** | Each key is hidden deep within a unique zone of the mansion — find all three to unlock the final escape door. |
| ⚡ **Tension System** | The game world reacts to your behavior — too much silence attracts Zuzuka, too much noise can alert her. |
| 👻 **Pursuit** | If Zuzuka finds you, run — or hide. She can’t be killed, only avoided. |
| 🧩 **Difficulty** | Each key you collect makes Zuzuka more aggressive and the environment more unstable. |

## 🔊 The Sound of Survival

Sound is your only weapon — and your biggest enemy.  
In **Hollowbound**, silence is deadly.  
If the environment goes quiet for too long, Zuzuka will begin hunting you.

You’ll learn to listen:

- **Static =** She’s close.  
- **Sudden silence =** She’s watching.  
- **Breaking the silence (a step, a door, a flicker) =** Your only defense.

The deeper you go, the more distorted reality becomes.  
Even your own footsteps may start to lie.

## 🔑 The Keys of Escape

There are three unique keys, each one representing a layer of the mansion’s history:

1. **The Rusted Key** – Found in the servant’s quarters, buried beneath decades of decay.  
2. **The Blooded Key** – Hidden in the dining hall, near where the last experiment took place.  
3. **The Signal Key** – The final piece, pulsing faintly with static light in the attic — where the experiment first began.

Once you collect all three, a final door at the end of the main corridor will unlock.  
But by then… **Zuzuka will no longer be hiding.**

## ⚠️ Hollowbound Survival Tips

- Never stop moving — silence attracts Zuzuka.  
- Keep track of where you’ve been — some doors lock behind you.  
- Use your flashlight sparingly — its battery drains fast.  
- If you hear static, hide.  
- Remember: each key brings you closer to freedom… and to her.

## 🧠 How We Came Up with the Idea

We are **Team 404 Code**, and none of us come from a traditional game development background.  
When this project came our way, we saw it as the perfect opportunity to try something completely new — something that would push our creativity and technical skills to the limit.

On the first day, we spent hours brainstorming what the story could be.  
There were a lot of debates, ideas flying everywhere, and even a few arguments about the direction we wanted to take.  

We all had different visions — some of us leaned toward a sci-fi thriller, others wanted something darker and more emotional.  
Eventually, we found common ground in the idea of **Hollowbound**, a psychological horror that represents what it truly means to be “lost” — cut off not just from the world, but from yourself.

In **Hollowbound**, you find yourself trapped in an isolated house, completely disconnected from mankind.  
You must collect keys, piece together clues, and face a terrifying presence that lurks within.  
The game draws slight inspiration from *Granny*, but we wanted to make it more personal — with a story that blends fear, guilt, and loneliness.

Since we were all new to Unity, the technical part was honestly the hardest.  
We ran into a lot of issues like rendering errors, scene loading bugs, lighting problems, audio glitches, and even broken scripts that refused to work when everything else seemed fine.  
Sometimes the assets wouldn’t align properly; other times the whole scene just crashed.  

For the first two days, we spent more time troubleshooting than actually developing.  
But we kept going — experimenting, reading documentation, and learning through trial and error.

Despite the challenges, our **computer science background and knowledge of C/C++** helped us understand the logic behind game mechanics, which made problem-solving easier over time.  
We built the game using **Unity**, and for character creation, we used **Meshy AI**, which allowed us to generate realistic 3D models from simple text prompts — a real lifesaver considering how time-consuming manual modeling can be.

The story focuses on a woman who was the victim of unethical scientific experiments, and the horror you experience comes from that tragic past.  
It’s less about jump scares and more about the **psychological weight of being trapped in isolation** — where silence itself becomes terrifying.

Gameplay revolves around exploration and interaction — pressing “E” to collect keys, discovering hidden clues, and surviving as you move through tense, dimly lit environments with custom sound effects that heighten the fear factor.  

And when it came to the ending, we decided to **break expectations**.  
We didn’t want the game to end in a typical horror way, so we added a small dose of humor — a funny grammatical twist that catches players off guard after all that tension.

This project took a lot of effort, patience, and sleepless nights.  
But it was also one of the most rewarding experiences we’ve had as a team.  

**Hollowbound** is still under development, but it already represents our passion, creativity, and determination to build something meaningful out of pure curiosity and teamwork.

We hope you enjoy exploring **Hollowbound** as much as we enjoyed bringing it to life — bugs, late nights, arguments, and all ☕️.
